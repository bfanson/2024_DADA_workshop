We will be following this workflow through the workshop. This workflow is likely familiar everyone. Here, we demonstrate how R (with Rstudio) can be used for every step, so you are using a single tool for every step.\r\n\r\nExample of a R/Rstudio workflow\r\nSo those are the basics and suspect most will be rather familiar with that workflow. But, examples speak volumes. Let’s go through an example of the fundamentals of my R/Studio workflow (I will show a few of my workflow)\r\nLet’s review\r\nProject folder structure\r\nhow do you name your project folder so easy to find\r\n\r\nData storage: three main folders raw, rds, spatial\r\nwhat are the key data folders you need for your project\r\n\r\nR scripts : import/data cleaning, analysis\r\n\r\nstructure within the scripts (example of importData.r)\r\n\r\nReport writing: Rmarkdown/Quarto file [day3]\r\n\r\n\r\nRmarkdown used to be the main report tool in R but recently Quarto has been slated to replace Rmarkdown. I am still using Rmarkdown.\r\nAdvantages of workflow\r\n“laziness” in data analysis programming\r\nreduce cognitive load\r\nreduce distractions (rabbitholes/“the weave”)\r\nefficiency\r\n\r\ncollaborations\r\na logical workflow makes for easy collaborations\r\n\r\nreproducibility\r\nlogical, clean workflows minimise error\r\nevery step is explicit in the code [no black boxes]\r\n\r\nCaveat on my R/Rstudio workflow\r\nMy R/Rstudio workflow has evolved over the years and reflects historical contingencies (e.g. working as analyst in pharmaceutical for 9 months, influential people I happened to meet).\r\nThis workshop will work off this framework but this workflow might not fit you per se. However, for those developing their workflow, it is useful to have an initial foundation in which to work off. So, as we go through this workshop, think about how you personalise the workflow for you:\r\nhow might you integrate your current process with the workflow presented?\r\nwhat unique aspects of your work need to be integrated into the workflow?\r\nwhat is the role of collaborators and meshing workflows?\r\nUpfront thinking about this is not time-wasted. If you have a great structure that inherently works for you, you will be more efficient.\r\nReady, set, go….\r\nOkay, we have the data and understand the project goals, design, and key questions. Let’s go through the basic steps to get going…\r\nP1: Setup your project folder\r\nIf new to Rstudio, it is worth checking out youtube tutorials (e.g. an example one ). We will try to show tips and tricks along the way.\r\nCreate Rproject using Rstudio\r\n\r\nCreate folder structure\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that “Rstudio” (the company) has rebranded to “posit”. It has also created a new IDE,0 Positron https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/wiki for note about new IDE\r\nCreate an importData.r script\r\n\r\nImportant concept of relative paths\r\nProbably the most important attribute of an Rstudio project is the idea of relative path. In your analysis, since you are using R code, you will need to point to files using file paths (e.g. “data/raw/data.xlsx”).\r\n\r\n\r\n# you can see the working directory by typing\r\n  getwd()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that I used forward slash “/” instead of backslash ““. In R, you need to use forward slash in file paths as backslash are special”escape” characters\r\nAn absolute path is the full path “C:/Users/bf0a/workshops/2024_WetlandGraze/data/raw/data.xlsx”. If you use absolute path, any time you change your computer or share your project across computers, you will need to change the path. A relative path means that you just need to specify the path from within the project folder.\r\nGiven that, it is important to open your project using the “project_name.Rproj” link, e.g. \r\nLet’s talk a look at my standard import script\r\n\r\n\r\nClick the outline button in upper right of the script screen to show the outline of script. The outline is created by the #### Text ####\r\nTidyverse\r\nAt the top of my script, I put library(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n\r\nTidyverse is big topic but here are key points that I want you know:\r\nTidyverse is an opinionated approach to data analysis and has spurred a movement of tidy-everything (tidygraphs, tidybayes, sf package, and so much more)\r\nRather than a package per se, it is really a collection of packages (aka meta-package)\r\nTidyverse goals\r\nmake R code more consistent\r\nmake R code more readable for humans\r\ncreate a cult\r\n\r\nA few key functions\r\nThere are lot of functions in tidyverse world. Below, I will just quickly introduce a few to show the human-readable attribute and give you your first exposure to what we will use later. These functions fall (very) loosely into three categories (though not mutually-exclusive): 1) dataset cleaning tools; 2) summarising; and 3) dataset reshaping/joins.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n# dataset cleaning tools\r\n  select()  # choose the columns you want [subset by column]\r\n  filter()  # choose the rows you want [subset by row]\r\n  arrange() # sort the columns\r\n  mutate()  # create a new variable\r\n\r\n# dataset summarising tools\r\n  group_by()    # implicitly breaks the dataset into separate groups\r\n  summarise()   # performs a summary statistic on each individual group\r\n\r\n# dataset reshaping and joining   \r\n  left_join()   # combining columns from two datasets\r\n  bind_rows()   # stacking dataset on top of each other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPipes: %>%\r\nA key component of tidyverse world is the concept of “pipes”. The pipe connects multiples steps into a single sequence of commands.\r\n\r\nJust to make things harder, a new pipe |> has been introduced. It is very similar to %>% but it does act a little different. We will just teach %\\>% because we are set in our ways\r\nBelow is an example of building a sentence. You start with a dataset (or other object) and then do things to that dataset, passing (%>%) onto the next thing thing.\r\nIn Rstudio, there is shortcut: ctrl + shift + M to add a pipe…use it!!!!.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n  library(tidyverse)\r\n  head(mtcars,10)   # mtcars is a built in dataset\r\n  mtcars %>% head(10)  # get mtcars, pass to head() function, take the first 10 rows \r\n\r\n# sentence using tidy functions we will dive into below...just follow basic logic\r\n  mtcars %>% \r\n    rename( cylinders = cyl ) %>% # chagne cyl to cylinder\r\n    mutate( mpl = round( mpg/3.79,2 ) ) %>%  # convert mpg to miles per liter (mpl)\r\n    select( mpg, mpl, cylinders )  # keep just the mpg and mpl and cylinders columns \r\n\r\n  #vs.\r\n  ds_m <- rename(mtcars, cylinders = cyl )          # change cyl to cylinder\r\n  ds_m <- mutate(ds_m, mpl = round( mpg/3.79,2 ) )  # convert mpg to miles per liter (mpl)\r\n  select(ds_m, mpg, mpl, cylinders )                # keep just the mpg and mpl and cylinders columns \r\n\r\n\r\nSide note - Version control/GitHub [Advanced topic]\r\nAs part of my due-diligence, I have to mention version control. In short, version control is external software that keeps track of all your changes (so you can go back if something breaks in your code) and very helpful with collaborations (e.g. allowing you both code away and then merging those changes).\r\nFor R/Rstudio, Git/GitHub is the most popular (and can be directly integrated). Now, Git is the version control software locally on your computer and it does the tracking of all changes In contrast, GitHub is an online platform in which you can upload those changes (and project folder/files) and is mainly useful for the collaboration/sharing (plus some other useful features)\r\nKey points on Git/GitHub:\r\nIf not collaborating, the overhead of Git (learning, initial setup, random breaks) might not worth it to you. You still have version histories via Onedrive to save you (not as easy to shift through as Git).\r\nIf collaborating, it really is the best approach that will save you effort in the long run.\r\nIt is worth playing around with GitHub online so you know how to navigate the website (this workshop will help with that). GitHub is a rich resource with example code and useful packages not on CRAN. GitHub project (aka repositories) can look intimidating at first.\r\nRstudio has git integration that makes it easier to work with, though the github desktop\r\nGitHub has GitHub pages which is hosting this website [workflow: 1) write RMD files in Rstudio; 2) upload to GitHub; 3) GitHub publishes at https:username.github.io/project_id]\r\nResearchers will host their packages on GitHub instead of CRAN\r\n\r\nCRAN is repository for packages and is teh default place to look for a package. As CRAN has certain rules/time-lags, some by-pass using other repositories like GitHub\r\nP2: Importing data\r\nAfter setting up environment, on to the import stage\r\nimport philosophy\r\nIn my workflow, I view data files as “locked(/read-only)”. This is part of the reproducibility pathway. So this means for me:\r\nI do not change filenames once the data go in that folder [e.g. if you do, you will forget where your file came and have to go digging]\r\nI will not touch anything in the files.\r\nEither I code around (so anyone can see the change)\r\nSend back to get it fix\r\n\r\nKey importing functions\r\nexcel files\r\nFor this, we will use readxl package\r\n\r\nThere are other read excel packages but this one just works\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n  library(readxl)\r\n  read_xls('data/raw/example.xlsx')\r\n  read_xlsx('data/raw/example.xlsx')\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should be aware of how it handles missing data. In read_xlsx() you can specify an argument na= to indicate what cell values should be treated as missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n  library(readxl)\r\n  read_xlsx( 'data/raw/missing.xlsx', na='' ) # default\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\r\n    var missing\r\n  <dbl> <chr>  \r\n1     1 NA     \r\n2     2 na     \r\n3     3 .      \r\n4     4 <NA>   \r\n5     5 Na     \r\n\r\n  read_xlsx( 'data/raw/missing.xlsx', na=c('NA','na') )\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\r\n    var missing\r\n  <dbl> <chr>  \r\n1     1 <NA>   \r\n2     2 <NA>   \r\n3     3 .      \r\n4     4 <NA>   \r\n5     5 Na     \r\n\r\ncsv/txt\r\nFor reading csv/txt\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n# from readr package in tidyverse\r\n  read_csv('data/raw/example.csv')    # comma delimited\r\n  read_table('data/raw/example.txt')  # tab delimited\r\n  read_delim('data/raw/example.ext', delim='#') # or other type of delimited \r\n  \r\n  ?read_csv  # to see arguments/options for importing\r\n\r\n\r\nDatabase [Advanced]\r\nSome possible packages to check:\r\nRMySQL: This package allows you to connect to MySQL databases and execute SQL queries1.\r\nRPostgreSQL: This package is designed for connecting to PostgreSQL databases1.\r\nRSQLite: This package is used for SQLite databases and is great for lightweight, serverless database applications1.\r\nRODBC: This package provides a way to connect to any database that supports ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)1.\r\nRJDBC: This package uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to connect to a wide variety of databases1.\r\nImporting our project files (starting with site)\r\n\r\n\r\n#_____________________________________________________________________________\r\n#### Global Variable/Settings ####\r\n  library(tidyverse)  # this brings in all the tidyverse packages\r\n  library(readxl)     # we will need this \r\n\r\n  file_excel <- 'data/raw/Workshop 2024 data.xlsx'   # created new variable to reference\r\n  \r\n#_____________________________________________________________________________  \r\n#### Section 1: site information ####\r\n# check sheet names in excel file\r\n  excel_sheets(file_excel)\r\n  \r\n  # bring in site data      \r\n  ds_site <- read_excel(file_excel, sheet = 'site_info')\r\n  \r\n  # take a look\r\n  head(ds_site)  # quick peak\r\n  View(ds_site)  # check out a datatable version...can also just click the object in the \r\n                 # environment panel in upper right\r\n  names(ds_site)  # have a look at object names\r\n\r\n\r\nP3: Data cleaning\r\nOverview of basics\r\nNow we have the first file in. That is the easy bit. However, we need to clean up dataset(s) so that they are ready for analysis. By cleaning I mean:\r\ncolumn management\r\nrenaming columns for coding\r\ndrop extra columns and extra rows\r\nmakes sure column types (e.g. numeric, character, factors, date) are correct\r\ndata entry errors in columns\r\nstring manipulations (e.g. combine two columns, split two columns)\r\n\r\ncheck design (aka get intimate ❤️ with the data)\r\nextract out the design elements to confirm it matches (or identity where is does not)\r\nmissing data [part of design missing?]\r\n\r\njoin together response variables, design, and covariates\r\nrestructure data for analysis (e.g. long vs wide form)\r\ncolumn management\r\ndropping/keeping columns - select()\r\nthe select() is used to select the columns you want. Here, we use it to drop the two columns we do not. The ‘…10’ was created automatically by read_excel() and not needed. We delete the columns using (-) negative in-front of the column we want to drop. We also learn if a column name has whitespace (or other special characters like %, #, …) you need to use quotes to refer to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  # let's delete that the extra column... use select(data, -var)\r\n  ds_site <- select( ds_site, -...10)  # drop the ...10\r\n#  ds_site <- select( ds_site, -Drop me)  # this does not work\r\n  ds_site <- select( ds_site, -\"Drop me\")  # need to use either \"Drop me\" or `Drop me` if you have whitespace\r\n\r\n\r\nrenaming columns - rename()\r\nYou will want to rename columns. It is important to think about what makes a good column name for you. I stick to the following\r\nno whitespaces, no special characters, not too long, (for me) all lowercase\r\nprefixes or suffixes (useful for select functions) [e.g. dates are dt_, datetime is dttm_, site info is site_)\r\n\r\n\r\n  # now, let's rename [I will show two ways: rename() and within select() ]\r\n  ds_site <- ds_site %>% \r\n    rename( site_lat = Transect.Start.Latitude,\r\n            site_lon = Transect.Start.Longitude ) %>% \r\n    select(cma, wetland=wetland_name, transect_id, fence, grazing, starts_with('site_') )\r\n\r\n\r\ncheck column type and convert - mutate()\r\nWhen you want to create a new column or modify an existing column, mutate() is the key function. We used it to convert lat/lon from character to numeric.\r\n\r\n\r\n # now, let's check column type\r\n  head(ds_site)  # <chr> = character\r\n  \r\n  # convert lat/lon to numeric...need to use mutate and will use as.numeric()\r\n  ds_site <- mutate(ds_site, \r\n                    site_lon_n = as.numeric(site_lon),\r\n                    site_lat_n = as.numeric(site_lat) ) # note the warning\r\n  filter(ds_site, is.na(site_lon_n)|is.na(site_lat_n) )  # warning cause it was missing..will get later from researcher\r\n\r\n  # now, I want to keep the site_lat/site_lon column but as numeric \r\n  ds_site <- select(ds_site, -site_lon, -site_lat) %>% \r\n              rename( site_lat = site_lat_n, site_lon = site_lon_n )\r\n  head(ds_site) # looking good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n# commmon conversion functions\r\n  as.numeric()\r\n  as.character()\r\n  as.factor()\r\n  as_date()  # note there is as.Date() and as_date()...use the later\r\n  as_datetime()  # note there is as.Date() and as_date()...use the later\r\n\r\n\r\nFor dates, this is another whole topic. I highly recommend you use the lubridate package for all date handling. See date webpage for a bit more info\r\nFor factors, be very careful when converting…\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n# factors are in essence an ordinal in that they are stored as numbers with labels\r\n  intensity <- c('low','medium','high') \r\n  intensity\r\n  class(intensity) # character\r\n  f_intensity <- as.factor(intensity)\r\n  f_intensity # now a factor and note the levels\r\n  as.numeric(f_intensity) # you get numbers\r\n\r\n# here is where the problem comes in...\r\n  ds_fish  <- data.frame( fish_id = c(1,2,6,7) ) # say you have fish id as a number\r\n  ds_fish  <- mutate(ds_fish, f_fish_id = factor(fish_id) ) # you convert fish_id to a factor for a model  \r\n  mutate(ds_fish, fish_id = as.numeric(f_fish_id) ) # you want to join it to another dataset and it needed to be numeric, you use as.numeric() you get the wrong numbers\r\n  # note - this use to be a bigger problem pre-tidyverse0\r\n\r\n\r\ndata issues and using filter()\r\nNext, we checked each column of interest to see if it matched our expectations. We introduced a string function str_to_sentence() to help. You also saw filter() and how to use that. The operators for fitler() are ==, !=, %in%. <aside>There are tons of string functions. Check the cheatsheet.\r\n\r\nWe also learned about pull(data, var) vs data$var way of getting a specific column from the dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n# first, you need to learn to grab a single column from a dataset\r\n  pull(ds_site, cma)  # this is tidyverse way\r\n  #vs\r\n  ds_site$cma  # this is the old base way\r\n  \r\n  # I will use $ method here as this is more common (or maybe I am just old(-school) )\r\n  table(ds_site$cma) # looks good\r\n  \r\n  table(ds_site$wetland) # looks good, no misspellings obvious, numbers not exactly 10\r\n  \r\n  table(ds_site$fence) # oops, yes vs Yes...capitalisation matters\r\n  ds_site <- mutate( ds_site, fence = str_to_sentence(fence) )  # let's use a string function\r\n  table(ds_site$fence) # Too easy!\r\n  \r\n  table(ds_site$grazing) # okay, was excepting just Crash/Press - was not expecting\r\n  ds_site <- filter(ds_site, grazing != 'NIL' )  # ! is used to say not\r\n  ds_site <- filter(ds_site, grazing %in% c('Crash','Press' ) )  # or you inverse way \r\n  table(ds_site$grazing) # all good\r\n\r\n\r\nP4: summarising data\r\nAfter you did initial column cleaning, we explored the experimental design to make sure that it was as expected. We found several issues and fixed them. We covered group_by() and combining with count(), summarise(), and mutate(). The key difference between summarise and mutate is that summarise returns a single row per group whereas mutate returns all initial row, adding in a the new variable.\r\nOnce grouped, the data stays that way until you ungroup() the data. This will trick you up!!!! If you do a calculation and cannot figure out why it is very wrong, check if data are still grouped. It is best to always ungroup() but that is not reality.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take the first(/last) number of rows, check out the family of slice() functions in dplyr. See the dplyr cheatsheet for examples\r\nAlso, we saw a ‘special’ function n() that you can use to call to get the number of rows in a group. Another useful function is row_number() which will give you the row number within each group (or the whole dataset is ungrouped).\r\n\r\n\r\n##### let's check experimental design #####  \r\n  \r\n  # Now, I want to understand this transect_id.  Is it unique?\r\n  # option1 - if unique, then there will be one per wetland\r\n  ds_dups <- group_by(ds_site, wetland, transect_id) %>% count(name='n')  # count() \r\n  filter(ds_dups, n > 1)  # there are 8 were it is not\r\n  \r\n  # okay, not expecting that...let's add in the number of duplicates so can understand better\r\n  ds_site <- group_by(ds_site, wetland, transect_id) %>% \r\n              mutate( n_dups = n() )  # we use mutate here so it keeps all rows\r\n  filter(ds_site, n_dups==2)          # both No and Yes\r\n  filter(ds_site, n_dups==2) %>% distinct(wetland)  # in three wetlands...\r\n    # in the above code, I use distinct() to return the unique level for wetland\r\n    # but as you saw, it returned transect_id as well.  This is because dataset is still grouped\r\n  ds_site <- ungroup(ds_site)\r\n  filter(ds_site, n_dups==2) %>% distinct(wetland)  # in three wetlands...\r\n  \r\n  # I was told that this was a data entry error and I should drop the Fence==No ones \r\n  filter(ds_site, n_dups==2 & fence=='No')  # let's see the ones to drop..n=8\r\n  nrow(ds_site)\r\n  ds_site <- filter(ds_site, !(n_dups==2 & fence=='Yes') ) # \r\n  nrow(ds_site)  # 300-8 = 292...all good\r\n     \r\n # I want to know how many transects in each...let's use group_by() and summarise()\r\n  ds_sum <- ds_site %>% \r\n              group_by(wetland, fence) %>%  # break up into separate wetlands and do a calculation on each group\r\n              summarise( n_transects = n() )\r\n  filter(ds_sum, n_transects!=5)  # huh, thought there were only 5, check with researcher why\r\n\r\n\r\nFew other examples\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n  mtcars # built in dataset\r\n  group_by(mtcars, cyl) %>% summarise( mean_mpg= round(mean(mpg),1), \r\n                                       sd_mpd= round(sd(mpg),1),\r\n                                       n = n() ) # n() is built in to count rows\r\n  # if you replace the same variable, all next calculation will be on the summarised variable\r\n  group_by(mtcars, cyl) %>% summarise( mpg= mean(mpg) %>% round(2), \r\n                                       max_mpg= max(mpg)%>% round(2),\r\n                                       min_mpg= min(mpg)%>% round(2) ) # see how min/max same\r\n\r\n\r\nP5: Restructure datasets\r\nOverview\r\nRestructuring is like a pivot table in Excel. It is going from wide to long (and vice versa). In our script, we used pivot_wider(). The reverse function is pivot_longer() which we did not use here.\r\n\r\n\r\n# I want to know the transect number differ between plot or are equal...restructure\r\n  ds_sum_wide <- pivot_wider( ds_sum, names_from=fence, values_from=n_transects )\r\n  head(ds_sum_wide)\r\n  filter(ds_sum_wide, No != Yes )  # might be worth double-checking if supposed to be\r\n\r\n\r\nuse of distinct()\r\nWe finished off Section 1 by using the distinct() [so more]. distinct() is really useful for extracting out design. distinct() finds the unique combination of all the variables listed in the function. We used to get the unique combination of wetland, grazing, fence. You also saw n_distinct() which is useful in mutate to count the number of unique levels in variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n# let's check that the number wetland per cma\r\n  group_by(ds_site, cma) %>% summarise( n_wetland = n_distinct(wetland) ) # option 1\r\n  distinct(ds_site, cma, wetland) %>% group_by(cma) %>% count()  # options 2\r\n  \r\n  # let's check full design using some of the techniques above\r\n  ds_design <- distinct(ds_site, wetland, grazing, fence) %>% \r\n                group_by(wetland) %>% \r\n                  summarise(n_grazing=n_distinct(grazing), \r\n                         n_fence = n_distinct(fence) )\r\n  # any \r\n    filter( ds_design, n_grazing>1 ) # nothing\r\n    filter(ds_design, n_fence!=2) # nothing\r\n  \r\n# we have wetland, grazing, fence, transect_id but missing temporal component\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting survey information\r\nMissing values\r\n\r\nNA can be tricky. In statistical models, any row with NA will be dropped quietly. When using functions like mean(), sd(), NAs will return NAs.\r\nA new topic learned in Section 2 was NAs. We used the is.na() function to filter out this cells. NA are special characters and you cannot just do filter(ds_site, wetland==NA) or filter(ds_site, wetland=='NA'). The former statement caused R to look for a variable called ‘NA’ and the latter makes R look for variable level ‘NA’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#_____________________________________________________________________________  \r\n#### Section 2: import survey info ####\r\n  ds_survey <- read_csv('data/raw/df_survey_info.csv') \r\n  ds_survey\r\n  \r\n  ds_survey <- ds_survey %>% \r\n                  select(-...1) %>% \r\n                  rename( dt_survey = date ) # I prefer dt_xxx for my dates\r\n  # check columns\r\n  ds_survey  # all <chr> except for <date> as expected\r\n  summary(ds_survey) # missing dates for dt_survey\r\n  \r\n  # let's check out the NAs...using is.na() function\r\n  filter(ds_survey, is.na(dt_survey))  # ...check with researcher\r\n  ds_survey <- filter(ds_survey, !is.na(dt_survey) )  # let's say they should be deleted\r\n\r\n  # I would check if any transects not in the site dataset\r\n  filter(ds_survey, !(transect_id %in% ds_site$transect_id) )\r\n  filter(ds_site, wetland == 'Hoch') # yep no wetland that is Hoch...oh that is right, it is the NIL we dropped\r\n  \r\n  filter(ds_survey, str_detect(transect_id,'Hoch')) # we want to drop these\r\n  ds_survey <- filter(ds_survey, !str_detect(transect_id,'Hoch')) # drop them\r\n\r\n  # okay, I want to check out dates \r\n  ggplot(ds_survey, aes(dt_survey)) + geom_dotplot()  # showing a graph...matches our expectation (no odd date)\r\n\r\n  # survey dataset is looking good\r\n  #now let's join survey info and site info \r\n  # first, I want to create wetland in the survey dataset\r\n  # I noticed an NA in graph\r\n  ds_survey <- separate_wider_delim(ds_survey,\r\n                                    cols = transect_id,\r\n                                    names=c('wetland','transect_no'),\r\n                                    delim='_',\r\n                                    cols_remove=F)\r\n  ds_survey \r\n  ds_survey <- ds_survey %>% select(-transect_no) # not needed at this point\r\n  \r\n  # second, check that there are not duplicates for survey_id, dt_survey\r\n  group_by(ds_survey, survey_id, dt_survey) %>% count() %>% filter(n>1) # yippe, all clean\r\n\r\n\r\nP6: Joining datasets\r\nmerges/combining joins\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n# whole suite joins....\r\n  left_join()  # stick this one\r\n  right_join() # just switch around to left_join\r\n  full_join()  # safer to create the fuller design (e.g. expand.grid) and then left_join() into it\r\n  inner_join() # safer to do left_join() and then filter()\r\n  outer_join() # just stick to left_join and filter()\r\n\r\n\r\nCommentary on merges/join (left_join)\r\nYou will join datasets all the time. In joins, (usually) you have two datasets and have something in common (e.g. site_id). For instance, you may have response variable in one dataset and covariates in another. You want to combine together.\r\nBe warned, joins can be major pitfalls!!!! If you are not intimate ❤️ with your datasets, it can lead to big issues. We showed this in our code in which we “forgot” to include transect_id:\r\n\r\n\r\n# as an example, left_join will warn you if it is not a one-to-one join\r\n  ds_mistake <- left_join( ds_survey, select(ds_site, wetland, fence, grazing) )\r\n  nrow(ds_mistake) # way bigger\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happened here is called a one-to-many join. I was expecting the left dataset (the first dataset) to have the same number of rows before and after the join. Instead, it has more, creating fake data (repeated) in essence (and increasing sample size, decreasing SEs, leading to erroneous stats). Therefore, you really need to keep tabs on number of rows.\r\nLuckily, dplyr::left_join() brought in a warning for this (I had my own function to warn me about this). My advice for you is to only use left_join() and make it a one-to-one join. Be careful being fancy in one-to-many and many-to-many (full_join) joins. Sometimes it is safer to work in separate steps rather than one big step.\r\nJoin for our project\r\nNow that is off my chest, let’s recall the joins we needed for our project…\r\n\r\n\r\n# now join in grazing, fence info...use a left_join and join by wetland, transect_id\r\n  nrow(ds_survey)\r\n  ds_survey <- left_join( ds_survey, \r\n                          select(ds_site, wetland, transect_id, fence, grazing) )\r\n  nrow(ds_survey) # same number as before, all good\r\n  \r\n  # as an example, left_join will warn you if it is not a one-to-one join\r\n  ds_mistake <- left_join( ds_survey, select(ds_site, wetland, fence, grazing) )\r\n  nrow(ds_mistake) # way bigger\r\n  \r\n#_____________________________________________________________________________  \r\n#### Section 3: import richness ####\r\n  excel_sheets(file_excel)\r\n  ds_richness <- read_excel(file_excel, sheet='spp_rich' )\r\n  ds_richness  # column types look good\r\n  \r\n  # only keeping native\r\n  ds_richness <- select(ds_richness, survey_id, native)\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  # let's add richness to ds_survey\r\n  # going to do a few checks\r\n  filter(ds_richness, !(survey_id %in% ds_survey$survey_id) ) # all good!\r\n  \r\n  # do a histogram/density plot\r\n  ggplot(ds_richness, aes(native)) + geom_histogram() + \r\n    geom_density(aes(y=after_stat(count) ),alpha=0.2, fill='red') # no obvious outliers at this point\r\n\r\n  # add richness to ds_survey \r\n  ds_richness_out <- left_join(ds_survey, \r\n                         ds_richness)\r\n  ds_richness_out  \r\n  \r\n  filter(ds_richness_out, is.na(native)) # 46 rows of NA...check with researcher\r\n\r\n\r\nConcatenating - Stacked joins\r\nI did not use concatenating in this dataset. A common use for this is when you have multiple files produced that have the same data structure (e.g. acoustic data from loggers, camera trap data, acoustic moth data) and you need to stack them together for the analysis. You will use bind_rows() for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### example below - do not include in your hands-on section script ####\r\n\r\n  ds1 <- data.frame( plot='plot1', quadrat=1:2, species_richness=c(10,20), comments=c('none','something'))\r\n  ds1\r\n\r\n   plot quadrat species_richness  comments\r\n1 plot1       1               10      none\r\n2 plot1       2               20 something\r\n\r\n  ds2 <- data.frame( plot='plot2', quadrat=1:2, species_richness=c(2,4))\r\n  ds2\r\n\r\n   plot quadrat species_richness\r\n1 plot2       1                2\r\n2 plot2       2                4\r\n\r\n  bind_rows(ds1, ds2)  \r\n\r\n   plot quadrat species_richness  comments\r\n1 plot1       1               10      none\r\n2 plot1       2               20 something\r\n3 plot2       1                2      <NA>\r\n4 plot2       2                4      <NA>\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is a bind_cols() to add columns next to each other. I rarely use, preferring to use a left_join() to make sure everything lines up\r\nP6: Saving the data files\r\nFinally, we have sparkly-clean datasets (and hopefully no hidden dirt under the rugs). The final step in the importData.r is to save in the data/rds to be used for the next step: modelling!\r\nRDS approach\r\nAt the end of the import and clean stage, I save the dataset(s) as an RDS file. The advantage of this method is that you are saving the dataset(s) in native R format so when you bring back in, there is no conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n#_____________________________________________________________________________  \r\n#### Section 5: save datasets ####\r\n    \r\n  saveRDS(ds_richness_out, 'data/rds/ards_richness.rds')    \r\n  saveRDS(ds_ht_out, 'data/rds/ards_height.rds')    \r\n\r\n\r\nExcel\r\nYou may want to save an excel file to share. You will need the writexl package for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n# excel file\r\n  writexl::write_xlsx( ds_richness, 'data/export/ards_richness.xlsx') \r\n\r\n\r\nCSV/Table\r\nOr if you prefer low overhead files (smaller size).\r\n\r\n\r\n readr::write_csv( ds_richness,file='ards_richness.csv')\r\n readr::write_delim( ds_richness,file='ards_richness.txt',delim = '\\t') # tab\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp!!!!!!!!\r\nWhen learning and using R, you will get stuck and need help. There are variety of help sources we use on a daily basis.\r\nBuilt-in to Rstudio are help files. This provides an initial starting place if you are interested in how to use a specific function. You just need to put “?” before the function and press run: ?mean() or use the Help tab\r\nGoogle search (e.g. stackoverflow, blogs) can be really helpful for finding new functions, packages, etc.\r\nBiometrics - happy to provide guidance/tips/thoughts\r\nARI’s QEARI - hacky hour or Teams chat\r\n\r\nAI is becoming more and more useful [I am finding the most useful]\r\nUsing AI for coding\r\nA few AI I use regularly:\r\nCopilot (Microsoft): allrounder AI which we have a free subscription at ARI. It does a decent job [I use this one daily]\r\nChatGPT: another allrounder similar to Copilot\r\nClaude: prefer this one for writing text but seems to work well too\r\nCopilot-GitHub: paid subscription but supposedly really good for programming\r\nFor those not regularly using AI, there are a few things that can help when running your searches for help:\r\nwhen asking for an example, include lots of specific to get closer to what you want. You may want to tell it to use only tidyverse functions for the example code. I often ask it to use a built-in dataset for the example so that I can check it right away.\r\nExperiment and Iterate: Don’t be afraid to experiment with the code generated by AI. Modify it, run it, and see what happens. If something is not working, you can ask point out the error and see if it can fix it\r\nUse AI for Debugging: If you encounter errors, AI tools can help you debug your code. They can suggest fixes and optimizations, making the debugging process less daunting.\r\nGive it try yourself copilot - type…“in R and using mtcars dataset show me how to get the mean mpg by each cyl level?” - if it used the aggregate() function, type the followup: “can you use tidyverse functions instead?”\r\n\r\nHands-on component\r\n\r\n\r\n Download project data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Task: Create your Rproject for the workshop and import data for analysis-ready datasets\r\nDownload the workshop data (refer to dataset webpage for background info if needed)\r\nSetup your workflow\r\nthink about your naming convention for the project names (does it have year, projectID, client). [My standard is “{Year}_{Researcher}_{Topic}”]\r\ncreate Rproject\r\ncreate folder structure (how do you want yours to look?)\r\n\r\nadd in datasets to your data folder [e.g. data/raw/]\r\ncreate your import script file [add to your script folder]\r\nwhat is your naming convention for R script (e.g. importData.R, 01_import.R, bringInData.R)\r\ncreate your R script structure (e.g. do you have headers, bookmarks)\r\n\r\nfill in script for what we have done so far\r\ngo through this “lecture” and grab script and paste into your script\r\ntest it along the way - paste in, highlight and run\r\n\r\nfinally, write your own script to bring maximum plant height tab\r\nimport plant height data from excel file\r\nclean the data\r\nmerge into the species richness dataset\r\nsave as a plant height RDS file (and try writexl)\r\n\r\nCheck compare your version to my using link below\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the link to my Rproject version:\r\n\r\n\r\n Download Rstudio project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermutation for Newbies\r\nIf your are new to R, you may have found the material a bit overwhelming. If so, it may be best to just download the Rproject that I have created for today and work your way through that.\r\nSteps:\r\nDownload the Rproject folder (see button above)\r\nSave in your preferred location on your laptop\r\nOpen the project by double clicking using the file with the .Rproj extention\r\n\r\nOnce in Rstudio, open the r/import.R file\r\nRun through the script highlighting each section and clicking Run button (or Ctrl+Enter shortcut)\r\n\r\nAdvanced topics [Advanced]\r\nQuality check packages\r\nIf you know that you will be updating the import of files repeatedly, it can be worthwhile to do some upfront QC/QA checks to ensure that the data coming in is clean. There are some packages to help with that.\r\nA few things to consider with these QA/QC:\r\nAre your data coming a database that already implements QA/QC [ideal world]\r\nAre you working with large datasets (lots of columns, separate tables)\r\nIs this an ongoing project so you will be updating regularly the analyses\r\nIs there an automation process [press run and get outputs at the end]\r\nIf you working with clean data or once off datasets, it may be best to just write your data cleaning checks as we have done here. The overhead of these packages unlikely to outweigh the added benefits. Once you are automating/updating dataset, the overhead is often easily outweighed.\r\nHere are two packages to have a look at…\r\nvalidate package\r\nYou can find an overview of this package on its github page\r\nThe validate package is intended to make checking your data easy, maintainable, and reproducible.\r\npointblank package\r\nYou can find an overview of this package on its github page\r\nThis package takes an data.frame, runs through a bunch of checks on each column and provides an useful report highlighting errors and warning (might be an error).\r\nThe basic steps are below in their graphic:\r\n\r\nMy thoughts: This package seems like a step-up in level of QA/QC from validate. I have used a few times but have not regularly implemented due to overhead. Probably becuase my brain is full, it takes a bit of re-leaning each time and I have not taken the time to create a template that minimises that effort.\r\nBig Data\r\nWhen data starts to get big (millions of row), tidyverse can struggle with speed. This is huge topic but will direct you to a couple useful packages that allows you to just learn dplyr but use other quicker processes\r\ndtplyr package\r\nunder the hood it uses the data.table package\r\nbut you write code in tidy/dplyr\r\n\r\ndbplyr package [if working with a database]\r\nhas the database do all the processes and return the result back to R\r\ntakes advantage of cloud computing\r\n\r\nLearn functions\r\nA fundamental skill in coding is creating functions. Packages are basically just collection of functions. I write functions all the time. This helps keep code clean, are reusable (so saves time), helps prevent cut/paste errors, and improves readability/reproducibility. Definitely worth learning as some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy_plus_function <- function(x,y){\r\n    x + y\r\n}\r\n\r\nmy_plus_function(1,2)\r\n\r\n\r\nResources\r\nObviously, we have only scratched the surface of the topics here. Here are couple books I have used but lots out there.\r\nR for Data Science\r\nAdvanced R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can use code below or the “Packages” tab in lower right panel in Rstudio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay’s learning objectives\r\nHave a good understanding of what Shiny apps can do and how it might be useful for you\r\nUnderstand the core structure of Shiny apps: UI, Server, Reactivity\r\nLearn how to create and run an App locally as well as deploy on ARI’s shiny account\r\nFeel confident enough to grab example code from Rshiny gallery ⛪\r\nKey packages\r\n\r\nOf course there is cheatsheet to check out…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"shiny.pdf\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject folder for today\r\n\r\n\r\n Download Rstudio project\r\n\r\n\r\nFor background information on the dataset, see dataset summary\r\nPep talk\r\nOkay, before we get started, I think that it is useful to give a pep talk. For the more programming-phobic of you, the Shiny code will look foreign. You first reaction might be “uggg, I am a researcher, not a programmer and I do not want to be programmer” and “are you serious after all this time I spent learning R coding and now I have to learn another type of programming??”\r\nBut, we swear that it is not a bad at it looks. Once you get beyond the foreignness of the code, we guarantee that with a little guidance, you can easily get started making your own apps in minutes. It is just about getting the basic structure and then having the confidence to do “trial-and-error” with borrowed code. Just be forewarned, shiny Apps can become addicting!!!\r\nUse of AI\r\nI will be using AI a fair a bit today. I have found really useful for getting started with shiny apps and for the basics (mostly what we covering here), it can really help. As noted in other days, it is helpful to have a few terminology/concepts under your belt when working with AI for shiny app creation. I will try to demonstrate this through this session. I will just work with Copilot (and maybe Claude for comparison?). I have more info in the page on AI extra topic.\r\nLet’s build one together\r\nGo through a simple example\r\nWe will work through an example of building a simple app that displays a graph depending on the conditions selected.\r\nI am going to work with the built-in mtcars dataset for the example. I want an user to select a the number of cylinders a car has and plot the relationship between horsepower(hp) and fuel efficiency (mpg).\r\n\r\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\r\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\r\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\r\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\r\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\r\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\r\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Copilot, I typed: “build me a shiny app using the mtcars dataset. The UI will have a side panel that will allow the user to select the cyl type and the main panel will have two tabs. The first tab will show a plot of the relationship between hp and mpg for the cyl selected by the user. The plot will also have the linear regression line and confidence band that was created using lm(). The second tab will have the linear model outputs extracted from the model using broom::tidy()”\r\nThe coding output are shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does run successfully and the UI looks like the following:\r\n\r\nWalk through the key bits\r\nSetting up the app\r\n\r\nONE vs MULTIPLE files\r\nFor your app setup, you can either select a single file called app.R [like we did in the example] or you can create two files: ui.R and server.R. What this is doing is just breaking up the one file into two, otherwise basically the same. The advantage of the latter is in larger apps and for reusing code. We will stick with one file method for rest of today.\r\nStructure of the file\r\nShiny app has a straightforward structure comprising four main components: 1) global heading; 2) ui; 3) server; and 4) shinyApp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual model of the file…\r\n\r\nLet’s go through each component…\r\nUI (= user interface)\r\nThis is what the user will be using to explore your data/results/visualizations.\r\nStep 1: pick a layout for UI\r\nFirst step is determining what kind of layout you want. Single panel, main panel with sidepanel, tabs. May want to check Shiny gallery or layout for ideas.\r\nIn our example, AI produced the following UI code using fluidPage() then breaking into sidebarLayout() and then again into sidebarPanel() and mainPanel(). Within the mainPanel() section, it added tabsetPanel() to get the tabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: create the inputs objects: buttons, inputs, drop-down menu\r\nOnce layout is figured out, now you add in the input objects. In our example that was a drop-down menu that allowed the user to pick cylinder size.\r\nCheck the cheatsheet for basic options for inputs or search Shiny gallery\r\n\r\nFew key takeways\r\nbasically creating html using simple functions\r\nfunctions are separated by commas!!!!\r\nAnd so many nested brackets!!!!\r\ninput\r\n\r\nIn the UI, an input list is created from the UI design and it is used to send user inputs to the server.\r\nTakeways\r\nlike an R list\r\nsetup by the UI\r\ncan only be changed by the user (immutable from being changed in the server code)\r\nserver\r\nThe server is the heart of the app. Let revisit the visual model…\r\n\r\nThree main key bits…\r\nYou have the inputs coming in that will be used\r\nR code that will take the inputs and convert to new output(s)\r\nthe output list is created and exported back to UI\r\nLet’s look a little closer at the server code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey takeways\r\nnot separated by commas\r\nmore like R programming but order does not matter between components!!!!!\r\nWithin renderXXX or reactive() R code and order does matter here. Note the double-brackets needed when multiple lines\r\noutput\r\nOur the server created output$hp_mpg_plot using renderPlot and output$model_summary using renderTable and the ui outputs using plotOutput and tableOutput. You get these pairs of renderXXX({}) and xxxOutput().\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook at the cheatsheet for a partial list of pairings…\r\n\r\nNote - this is not a comprehensive list and packages might have then own renderXxx() and xxxOutput()\r\nCouple more examples…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle more on the server side\r\nReactivity\r\nThe style of programming used in shiny apps is called “reactive programming”. The purpose of this programming style is to keep inputs and outputs in sync. To do this efficiency, you only want to update outputs that need to be changed. So the rule is “change if and only if inputs change”.\r\nIn our example we had one such case. This reactive function was then used in both renderXXX functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two key components of this are called:\r\nlazy - only do work when called to [“procrastinate as long as possible”]\r\ncache - save the results produced when first called and use that until something changes\r\nYou will see a variety of functions that are doing “extra” bits in the programming:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not go into depth here but just want you to be aware and when you see them, know that they are doing extra stuff and a bit of efficiency stuff. For more complicated apps, they are essential to get a handle of.\r\nShiny Extensions\r\nAs noted about, search the Shiny gallery to get ideas of additional options of what you can do. On this website, it provides all the ui/server code on a GitHub repository, so you can just grab the code.\r\nAnother good place to search for additional extensions for shiny is Shiny Awesome which has a curated list and some of the stuff, is well, awesome! (and overwhelming) The links often lead you to GitHub pages.\r\nDashboards\r\nshinydashboards package\r\nThis package helps with setting up dashboard layouts (columns, rows, matrix) as well as a suite of html objects (e.g. messages, notifications), aesthetics (“skins”), and other more bespoke tools. Check out https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/ for examples and overview.\r\nflexdashboard package\r\nFlexdashboard can be useful way to quickly create a layout using Rmarkdown-like file. At the simplest, you can create an interactive dashboard with no reactivity. If you want reactivity (e.g. inputs), then you can still use the template and integrate selectInput() functions and renderXXX() functions without explicitly defining ui/server. It is a bit of a hybrid approach between Rmarkdown/Quarto and shiny App. Not sure how much this package is still being developed??\r\nFor a range of examples: https://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/articles/examples.html\r\nAn example as a shiny App run in a Rmarkdown file, see https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-ggplot2-diamonds/.\r\nUseful interactive packages for shiny\r\nAs Shiny apps are all about interactivity, you will want to use interactive plots. Check the following webpage for a examples of packages that have interactivity. I will show a few common ones below:\r\nleaflet\r\nmapview package\r\nThe mapview package can be used to set up a simple, quick leaflet. This would be most useful when the leaflet is created on startup (not adding in reactivity like adding or deleting data being shown). For instance, you might want to show all the sites surveyed and attach metadata (e.g. dates surveyed, number of fish caught, number of plots) to that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful shiny functions for Server/UI…\r\n\r\n\r\n  mapview::renderMapview()  # server side\r\n  mapview::mapviewOutput()  # UI side\r\n\r\n\r\nleaflet package\r\nNow, if you are going to build maps that will change with user input, it is best to build from “scratch” using leaflet package (and probably leaflet.extra package + others)\r\nWhen you have user inputs affecting the map shown, you want to try to avoid rebuilding the map object and rather just modify the elements that the user wants changed (e.g. drop lines and add points instead). This requires using reactive programming and observe() functions. Check out Nev’s ibis app that does this. Below just shows simple leaflet code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful shiny functions for Server/UI…\r\n\r\n\r\n  leaflet::leafletOutput()  # UI side\r\n  leaflet::renderLeaflet()  # server side - creates the basemap\r\n  leaflet::leafletProxy()   # this is the server function that updates the map \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplotly\r\nNow, plotly package does a great job at interactive plots. You can write you code in ggplot and then just convert as shown in code below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  library(ggplot2)\r\n  library(plotly)\r\n  f <- ggplot( cars, aes(speed, dist)  ) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\r\n   plotly::ggplotly(f)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful shiny functions for Server/UI…\r\n\r\n\r\n  plotly::renderPlotly()\r\n  plotly::plotlyOutput()\r\n\r\n\r\nggiraph\r\nAgain, you can build your plots using ggplot and convert. I like this one for linking up plots…below, put your cursor over a dot on the left or a bar on the right. If you know CSS, it can be pretty powerful…\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggiraph)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(patchwork)\r\n\r\nmtcars_db <- rownames_to_column(mtcars, var = \"carname\")\r\n\r\n# First plot: Scatter plot\r\nfig_pt <- ggplot(\r\n  data = mtcars_db,\r\n  mapping = aes(\r\n    x = disp, y = qsec,\r\n    tooltip = carname, data_id = carname\r\n  )\r\n) +\r\n  geom_point_interactive(\r\n    size = 3, hover_nearest = TRUE\r\n  ) +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"Displacement vs Quarter Mile\",\r\n    x = \"Displacement\", y = \"Quarter Mile\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  theme_bw()\r\n\r\n# Second plot: Bar plot\r\nfig_bar <- ggplot(\r\n  data = mtcars_db,\r\n  mapping = aes(\r\n    x = reorder(carname, mpg), y = mpg,\r\n    tooltip = paste(\"Car:\", carname, \"<br>MPG:\", mpg),\r\n    data_id = carname\r\n  )\r\n) +\r\n  geom_col_interactive(fill = \"skyblue\") +\r\n  coord_flip() +\r\n  labs(\r\n    title = \"Miles per Gallon by Car\",\r\n    x = \"Car\", y = \"Miles per Gallon\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  theme_bw()\r\n\r\n# Combine the plots using patchwork\r\n combined_plot <- fig_pt + fig_bar + plot_layout(ncol = 2) \r\n\r\n# Combine the plots using cowplot\r\n# combined_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(fig_pt, fig_bar, ncol=2) \r\n\r\n# Create a single interactive plot with both subplots\r\ninteractive_plot <- girafe(ggobj = combined_plot)\r\n\r\n# Set options for the interactive plot\r\ngirafe_options(\r\n  interactive_plot,\r\n  opts_hover(css = \"fill:cyan;stroke:black;cursor:pointer;\"),\r\n  opts_selection(type = \"single\", css = \"fill:red;stroke:black;\")\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful shiny functions for Server/UI…\r\n\r\n\r\n  ggiraph::renderGirafe()\r\n  ggiraph::ggiraphOutput()\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s get our hands dirty…\r\n\r\nYour Task\r\nBuild a shiny app to communicate Day 2 analysis results to your client\r\nStep1: setup your app page with the 4 parts: global, ui, server, run\r\nStep2: design a UI [ layout, user inputs to be passed to server]\r\nStep3: create server functions\r\nStep4: test your app by “Run App”\r\n\r\nYou can download our version:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional resources\r\nFor useful resources: https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/\r\nGood for basic shiny https://mastering-shiny.org/\r\nEngineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps \r\nhttps://engineering-shiny.org/index.html \r\n\r\nAsides can be useful for preso.\r\n\r\nBeyond showing results\r\nI/O: Uploading files\r\nI/O: Saving user inputs\r\nI/O: Downloading\r\n\r\nThink about how shiny Apps might be useful\r\nVisualising data for clients\r\nIbis Tracker - Nev’s masterpiece\r\nhttps://arisci.shinyapps.io/ibisTracker/\r\nData sharing - upload\r\nModel simulations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
