Preferably alongside RStudio. It is recommended that you use versions of R > 4.0.0. So if you haven‚Äôt updated recently, it might be a good time to do so.\r\nIf you are using a DEECA machine and and you do not have an open workstation then you may find it difficult to install R, RStudio and a range of R packages. It is recommended you have a workstation setting that allows you to download and install programs (like R and R packages). This is something you need to apply for through the DEECA IT service portal if you have not already. You should also have Rtools installed. Below we list a step-by-step guide to the installation of system dependencies for Windows if they are not already installed:\r\nInstall R (preferably version > 4.0.0): https://cran.rstudio.com/\r\nDownload the version of Rtools matching your R installation: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\r\nInstall RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\r\nPackage Dependencies\r\nFor our workshop we will probably be downloading some packages on the fly, but if you want to make sure you have the relevant packages installed then you can run the following chunk:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop prerequisites\r\nUmmm, pretend that I forgot everything about Rstudio (asking for a mate)‚Ä¶\r\nintroduction to Rstudio use‚Ä¶<>\r\n\r\n‚Ä¶and maybe a refresher on R as well??\r\nintroduction to Rstudio use‚Ä¶<>\r\n\r\nWait, what is this Posit thing?

During each day‚Äôs session, we will cover a new topic in the workflow pipeline. The session will be a mix of lecturing/showing with hands-on section.\r\nMonday 2024SEP16: Overview of workflow, importing, cleaning\r\nTuesday 2024SEP17: Analysis of data\r\nWednesday 2024SEP18: Creating reports\r\nThursday 2024SEP19: Creating shiny Apps\r\nImportantly, tea will be provided!! üòÑ\r\nWhat to expect\r\nApproach\r\nCompared to when we started providing biometrics workshops, the amount of resources and online learning tools has exploded. Partly as a consequence, there has been a homogenization of workflow driven by key leaders in the area that have pushed the technology and analysis paradigms.\r\nGiven this, we will attempt in this workshop to act more as a guide to help you develop a solid framework that you can use as a launching point. We will point out amazing resources out but also hoping that workshop will give you the foundation to dive deeper into the topics specific to your research/needs.\r\nDuring this workshop, we will use our workflow cheatsheet to structure the workshop:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n  knitr::include_graphics(\"pdfs/workflow.pdf\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed to take a step-back at times\r\nFor some, the last two days might push their limits but they are important skills to develop as how we communicate research (and the expectations) is changing quickly.\r\nOn Day 3 (creating reports), the Quarto(/Rmarkdown) approach takes a bit to get used to if you are WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This can take a little bit to get used and best to take in steps. Most importantly, once you get a template to work from, you can usually modify fairly easily, often having no clue how most of it works.\r\nNow, for Day 4 (Shiny Apps), Shiny is going to look (frustratingly??) different as shown below (heads up):\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\n\r\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\r\nui <- fluidPage(\r\n  fluidRow( \r\n    selectInput('x','X-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    selectInput('y','Y-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    plotOutput('plot') \r\n)\r\n)\r\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\r\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\r\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\r\n    plot( mtcars[,input$x], mtcars[,input$y] )\r\n    \r\n  })\r\n}# Run the application \r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, shiny apps have a very basic structure and once you get that (and a few other key bits), you can often grab other people‚Äôs code and modify slightly to get what you need.\r\nThe goal here is not to make you a programmer but familiar with the tools that you can tinker away.\r\nPlug for QEARI\r\nJust a reminder QEARI (Quantitative Ecology ARI) is a great resource and a safe place for asking ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions. The amount expertise among its regulars is impressively! There are multiple channels to ask questions including a new one for shiny Apps!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
