If your R version is <4.0, it is a good time to update. R is the programming software that does the computations for your analyses. Using R is made much easier by using it through RStudio (_I_ntegrated _D_evelopment _E_nvironment).\r\nIf you are using a DEECA machine and and you do not have an open workstation then you may find it difficult to install R, RStudio and a range of R packages. It is recommended you have a workstation setting that allows you to download and install programs (like R and R packages). This is something you need to apply for through the DEECA IT service portal if you have not already. You should also have Rtools installed.\r\nTo install, the order of steps are as below:\r\nInstall R (> 4.0.0): https://cran.rstudio.com/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\program files‚Äô and accept all defaults\r\n\r\nDownload the version of Rtools matching your R installation: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\Data‚Äô and accept defaults\r\n\r\nInstall RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\Data‚Äô and accept defaults\r\n\r\nOpen Rstudio as you would any other program to check that it opens. If so, move onto installing packages below\r\nPackage Dependencies\r\nOne of the strengths of R is that it is open-source and collaborators can contribute their own code in the form of packages. For our workshop we will be downloading some packages on the fly, but one tidyverse will be across days so please download ahead of time (copy code below and paste into R):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop prerequisites\r\nUmmm, pretend that I forgot everything about Rstudio (asking for a mate)‚Ä¶\r\nintroduction to Rstudio use‚Ä¶<>\r\n\r\n‚Ä¶and maybe a refresher on R as well??\r\nintroduction to Rstudio use‚Ä¶<>\r\n\r\nWait, what is this Posit thing?

During each day‚Äôs session, we will cover a new topic in the workflow pipeline.\r\nMonday 2024SEP16: Overview of workflow, importing, cleaning\r\nTuesday 2024SEP17: Analysis of data\r\nWednesday 2024SEP18: Creating reports\r\nThursday 2024SEP19: Creating shiny Apps\r\nWithin each day, the session is structured to be mainly talk and chalk for the first half and then more hands-on for the second half.\r\nNote - We will not be offended if you just stay for the first half\r\nImportantly, tea will be provided!! üòÉ\r\nWhat to expect\r\nApproach\r\nCompared to when we started providing biometrics workshops, the amount of resources and online learning tools has exploded. Partly as a consequence, there has been a homogenization of workflow driven by key leaders in the area that have pushed the technology and analysis paradigms.\r\nGiven this, we will attempt in this workshop to act more as a guide to help you develop a solid framework that you can use as a launching point. We will point out amazing resources out but also hoping that workshop will give you the foundation to dive deeper into the topics specific to your research/needs.\r\nMay need to take a step-back at times\r\nFor some, the last two days of the workshop might push their limits but they are important skills to develop as how we communicate research (and the expectations) is changing quickly.\r\nOn Day 3 (creating reports), the Quarto(/Rmarkdown) approach takes a bit to get used to if you are WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). The key is focus on the higher level concepts (e.g.¬†how it could be useful for you, focus on the higher level concepts (e.g.¬†losing the forest for the trees)). Most importantly, once you have a template to work from and understand a key fundamentals, you can modify easily (often having no clue how most of it works‚Ä¶my approach for years (still?) to be honest).\r\nNow, for Day 4 (Shiny Apps), Shiny is going to look (frustratingly/scaredly/freakishly) different as shown below (heads up):\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\n\r\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\r\nui <- fluidPage(\r\n  fluidRow( \r\n    selectInput('x','X-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    selectInput('y','Y-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    plotOutput('plot') \r\n)\r\n)\r\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\r\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\r\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\r\n    plot( mtcars[,input$x], mtcars[,input$y] )\r\n    \r\n  })\r\n}# Run the application \r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, shiny apps have a very basic structure and once you get that (and a few other key bits), you can often grab other people‚Äôs code and modify slightly to get what you need.\r\nReminder - The goal here is not to make you a programmer but familiar with a few key tools so that you can tinker away.\r\nPlug for QEARI\r\nJust a reminder QEARI (Quantitative Ecology ARI) is a great resource and a safe place for asking ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions. The amount of expertise among its regulars is impressive! There are multiple channels to ask questions including a new one for shiny Apps!!!\r\n\r\nWhat to do when my brain hurts‚Ä¶\r\nZen out while checking out the 367 Collins Peregrines‚Ä¶.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These sites were spread across four Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) but with the majority of sites in the western CMAs. Sites were chosen partly to cover a wide variation in grazing intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n  #sf_cma <- VicmapR::vicmap_query(layer='open-data-platform:cma100') %>% collect()\r\n  #sf::write_sf(sf_cma, 'sf_cma.gpkg')\r\n  mapview::mapview(sf_cma, zcol='cmaname', layer.name='cma') + \r\n    mapview::mapview(sf_site, zcol='grazing', layer.name='site', col.regions=c('red','blue') )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\nIn each wetland, we are assessing how vegetation changes over time inside two trial plots. Each trial plot is about 0.25 ha in size. One plot is open to the grazing management being applied in the wetland and the other plot is fenced to exclude livestock (sheep and cattle). Monitoring is done when the wetland is drying out but still wet as this is the when most wetland plants are present. Monitoring is done along transects and quadrats in each plot before fencing, and then every year after fencing for 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nDesign variables\r\nSo, we have a hierarchical experimental design: site/plot/transect/quadrant. Treatments are at two levels. First, we have grazing intensity: crash (intense grazing) or press (less intense). This is at the site level. Next, we have a paired design within a site with fence.\r\n\r\nA large suite of responses were measured in this study. All For the workshop we will focus on two response metrics measured at the quadrat level:\r\nSpecies richness: total number of species\r\nMaximum plant height: measured the tallest plant in the quadrat\r\nData provided\r\nOverview\r\nWe have three files:\r\nWorkshop 2024 data.xls - this is our main file\r\ndf_quad_spp.csv - this includes extra quadrat-level about species present\r\ndf_survey_info.csv - this contains survey info, such as date\r\nLet‚Äôs take a look at\r\nWorkshop 2024 data.xls\r\nThis workbook has four tabs of data.\r\nsite_info tab\r\n\r\nspp_traits tab\r\n\r\nquad_ht tab\r\n\r\nspp_rich tab\r\n\r\ndf_quad_spp.csv\r\n\r\ndf_survey_info.csv\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
